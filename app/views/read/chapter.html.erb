        <p>God? God's turning people into insect monsters Beth. I'm the one beating them to death. Thank me. 
        I am not putting my father in a home! He just came back into my life, and you want to, grab him and, 
        stuff him under a mattress like last month's Victoria's Secret?! I'm a bit of a stickler Meeseeks, 
        what about your short game? We don't whitewash it either, Morty. I mean, the pirates are really rapey.</p>

        <p>Dont mind those stare goblins. We all wanna die, we're meeseeks! Nice one, Ms Pancakes. 
        Yeah, well, tough titties.</p>

        <p>Right, Crocubot. So, you're half cold unfeeling reptile, half also cold equally unfeeling machine? 
        Lemme hear everybody say hey-yo! All the ladies say yeaaah! Everybody over thirty do this with your hand! 
        Everybody with a red shirt jump up and down! Yo, everyone whose first name begins with an L who isn't hispanic, 
        walk in a circle the same number of times as the square root of your age times teeenn! Don't be a baby! 
        You avoid getting shot in real life all the time, Morty! Just do the same thing here and we'll be fine! 
        This is because you give Morty Smith bad grades, bitch!</p>

        <p>I'll be with Reuben in my workshop while you guys are having another day in Phil Collin's proverbial paradise. 
        You don't know me! Nice, Mrs Pancakes. Real nice. It's called carpe diem Morty. Look it up.</p>
